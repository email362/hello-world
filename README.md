# hello-world
first repository for initial ideas

Hi team!

Chris here, I like web development and I'm trying to further my knowledge and understanding of web languages like html, css, and javascript by learning on different websites like codeacademy, freecodecamp, and udacity. I also want to further my knowledge of github and how to utilize it to its full potential. Hopefully I succeed in this endeavor. Wish me luck!
